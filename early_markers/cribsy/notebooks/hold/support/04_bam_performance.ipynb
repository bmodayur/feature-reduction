    "# 04 - Bayesian Assurance Model (BAM) for Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: This notebook implements the Bayesian Assurance Model (BAM) workflow for planning new studies to determine the optimal sample size for achieving a desired precision (Highest Posterior Density Interval width) for key diagnostic metrics like Sensitivity and Specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs**:\n",
    "- Pilot study data, represented by `PILOT_RATE`, `TOTAL_N`, and `CORRECT_N`, which define the prior for the Bayesian model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs**:\n",
    "- `bac_sensitivity_{width}.png`, `bac_specificity_{width}.png`: Assurance curve plots showing the probability of achieving the target HPD width at different sample sizes.\n",
    "- `bammer_accuracy.pkl`: A pickled `Bammer` object containing the full state of the last-run analysis (for Specificity)."

    "### 4.1 BAM Implementation and Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell contains the complete implementation and execution of the Bayesian Assurance Method simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imports and Setup**: Imports necessary libraries (`pymc`, `arviz`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`) and sets up global constants for the simulation (`NUM_CORES`, `MAX_SAMPLE`, `PILOT_RATE`, etc.).\n",
    "- **`BamResult` Class**: A dataclass to store and process the results of a BAM simulation for a single target width, including methods to interpolate between sample sizes and assurances.\n",
    "- **`Metric` Enum**: Defines the diagnostic metrics that can be analyzed (e.g., Sensitivity, Specificity).\n",
    "- **`Bammer` Class**: The main orchestration class. It takes a metric and pilot data, then runs the simulation across a range of sample sizes to calculate the probability (assurance) of achieving a target HPD width.\n",
    "- **Simulation Loop**: The `_plot_assurance_curve` method contains the core simulation logic:\n",
    "    1. It iterates through different sample sizes (`n`).\n",
    "    2. For each `n`, it simulates 500 hypothetical future studies using `pm.sample_prior_predictive`.\n",
    "    3. For each simulated study, it updates the Bayesian model and calculates the resulting HPD width.\n",
    "    4. It computes \"assurance\" as the proportion of simulated studies that met the target HPD width.\n",
    "- **Execution**: The final loop instantiates the `Bammer` for Sensitivity and Specificity and runs the analysis for a target width of 0.2."
